# 🍝 Odin Recipes | Day 10 - #100DaysOfCode

This is my solution to the **Odin Recipes** project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), completed as part of **Day 10** of my [#100DaysOfCode journey](https://github.com/devxsameer/100-days-of-code).   [Click Here for Live Demo](https://devxsameer.github.io/odin-recipes/).

## 🧑‍🍳 What This Project Does

A simple HTML-only website that showcases a list of recipes.  
Each recipe has its own dedicated page with:

- A recipe title
- A description
- Ingredients list
- Step-by-step cooking instructions
- Internal links for easy navigation

---

## 🧰 What I Used

- **HTML5** only (no CSS or JS)
- Semantic tags for clean structure
- Relative links for multi-page navigation
